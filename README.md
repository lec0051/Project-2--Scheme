  #### Summary
  Lee County is organizing a county fair over the upcoming summer. You and another friend participate in several games including the bucket ball game. Each player is assigned a bucket to start with and the player that gets the bucket with the highest score wins the game. The worth of each bucket is calculated as follows:
  
  A bucket contains 10 balls of four different colors - red, blue, white, and green. Each red ball is worth 10 points, each green ball is worth 15 points, each blue ball is worth 20 points, and each white ball is worth 1 point.
  
  The goal is to write a computer program in Scheme to look at a bucket and decide how many points it is worth.
